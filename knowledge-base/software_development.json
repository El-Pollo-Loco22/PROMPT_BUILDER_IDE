      "rule": "Specify the programming language and version",

    {
      "rule": "Include error handling requirements",
      "why": "Without explicit instruction, models often omit try/except blocks and edge cases"
    },
    {
      "rule": "Define input/output examples",
      "why": "Few-shot examples dramatically improve output accuracy for code generation"

    {
      "rule": "State the testing framework if tests are expected",
      "why": "Models default to unittest; specifying pytest or another framework avoids rewrites"

      "rule": "Mention dependency constraints",
